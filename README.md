# Tic-Tac-Toe-C
 Working perfectly. Just fixed everything. 
   
   I've done a TicTacToe game in past but it wasn't so good.
   This one was created with the purpose of correcting the other one.
   Fixed the glitch.

   I'll use this logic to create another one in Python soon.
   But in Python I'll try to use a GUI to get a better version.
   For now that's it.
